      2. Reverse a Number
      3. Check Palindrome
      4. GCD Or HCF
      5. Armstrong Numbers
      6. Print all Divisors (38 XP :( )
      7. Check for Prime
      
   2. **Learn Basic Recursion**
      1. Understand recursion by print something N times
      2. Print name N times using recursion
      3. Print N to 1 using recursion
      4. Sum Of First N Numbers (39 XP :( )
      5. Factorial Numbers Not Greater Than N to copy
